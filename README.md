# nifemi-l.github.io

This is my personal website, adapted from [Maya Nigrin](https://github.com/mayigrin)’s site, which was built using the following two free HTML/CSS templates:
  - https://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page237/n5  
  - http://www.tooplate.com/view/2087-kalay

All credit goes to Maya and the original template creators. I’ve customized the some of the content and layout to fit my own work and style.
